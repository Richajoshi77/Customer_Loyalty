				<h2> MODEL </h2>
				<div class= m1>
					
				In this project I have used three algorithms that is Light GBM, XG Boost and Neural network. 
					Light GBM and XG Boost are fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision 
					tree algorithm, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Advantages of Light GBM and XG Boost are:
					<br>
					<br>
					1.	Faster training speed and higher efficiency: Use histogram-based algorithm i.e it buckets 
						continuous feature values into discrete bins which fasten the training procedure. <br><br>
					2.	Lower memory usage: Replaces continuous values to discrete bins which result in lower memory usage. <br><br>
					3.	Better accuracy than any other boosting algorithm: It produces much more complex trees by following leaf wise 
						split approach rather than a level-wise approach which is the main factor in achieving higher accuracy. <br><br>
					4.	Compatibility with Large Datasets: It is capable of performing equally good with large datasets with a significant 
						reduction in training time. <br><br>
