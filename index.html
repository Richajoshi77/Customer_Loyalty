					<h2> OVERVIEW </h2>
					<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
					<P> Elo was launched in 2011 by three of Brazil's largest banks (Banco do Brasil, Bradesco and CAIXA), and is the first 100% Brazilian payment brand. In order to be a robust and comprehensive brand, Elo offers a wide range of products and services aimed at all audiences. Elo is accepted at 7.5 million establishments across the country and is also the first domestic payment brand with international acceptance.

	                  <h3>DATA DESCRIPTION</h3>
	                  <p>The historical_transactions.csv and new_merchant_transactions.csv files contain information about each card's transactions. historical_transactions.csv contains up to 3 months' worth of transactions for every card at any of the provided merchant_ids. new_merchant_transactions.csv contains the transactions at new merchants (merchant_ids that this particular card_id has not yet visited) over a period of two months. merchants.csv contains aggregate information for each merchant_id represented in the data set.  <br>

	             		<br>

					<strong>The data is formatted as follows: </strong> 
				
					</p>

					
					<p>
					train.csv and test.csv contain card_ids and information about the card itself - the first month the card was active, etc. train.csv also contains the target.  <br>

		
					historical_transactions.csv and new_merchant_transactions.csv are designed to be joined with train.csv, test.csv, and merchants.csv. They contain information about transactions for each card, as described below. </p> 


					<h3> FILE DESCRIPTIONS</h3>

					<strong>train.csv</strong> - the training set: There are total 201,917 rows and 6 variables in training set. <br>
					<strong>test.csv </strong> - the test set: There are total 123,623 rows and 6 variables in the test set.  <br>
					
					<strong>historical_transactions.csv </strong>- historical transactions for each card_id. There are total 29,112,361 rows and 14 variables in the historical transactions dataset.  <br>
					<strong>merchants.csv </strong>- additional information about all merchants/ merchant_ids. There are total 334,696 rows and 22 variables in old merchant dataset. <br>
					<strong>new_merchant_transactions.csv </strong> -  data for each card_id containing all purchases that card_id made at merchant_ids that were not visited in the historical data. There are total 1,048,575 and 14 variables in new merchant dataset. <br>

	         		 <h2> PROBLEM STATEMENT </h2>
					<p> Credit cards are the number one payment method for online purchases. And Elo has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. But do these promotions work for either the consumer or the merchant? Do customers enjoy their experience? Do merchants see repeat business? Personalization is key. Elo has built machine learning models to understand the most important aspects and preferences in their customersâ€™ lifecycle, from food to shopping. But so far none of them is specifically tailored for an individual or profile. So now they wanted to see their each customer loyalty scores. </p> 

					<h2> APPROACH </h2>

	         		 <p>
	         		Try to understand the customers behavior by analyzing the historical and current transactions along with examining the old and new merchants data. And develop machine learning model to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering the customer loyalty.  It will help Elo to reduce unwanted campaigns and to create the right experience for customers. It also, help the company to tailor the specific promotions (discounts) to their loyal customers.
