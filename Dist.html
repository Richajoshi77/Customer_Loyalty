							<strong>Fig 1.</strong> Below shows the histogram and scatter plot of loyalty scores of the customers in the train set. We can see that some of the loyalty values are far apart (less than -30) compared to others. We have about 2207 rows, which has values different from the rest. Even if those rows were remove from the data, the model performance was not better. So the rows were not dropped. </p>

						Bar graphs represents the 3 feature columns in the dataset and their categories count.  <br> <br>
							Feature 1 has 5 categories, feature 2 has 3 categories and feature 3 has 2 categories. <br> <br> The violin plot shows the distribution of the different categories in all three features. Looking at the graph the distribution of categories looks kind of similar.
