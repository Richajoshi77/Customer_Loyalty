				In this project I have used three algorithms that is Light GBM, XG Boost and Neural network. 
					Light GBM is a fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithm, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. 
					Advantages of Light GBM
					1.	Faster training speed and higher efficiency: Light GBM use histogram-based algorithm i.e it buckets continuous feature values into discrete bins which fasten the training procedure.
					2.	Lower memory usage: Replaces continuous values to discrete bins which result in lower memory usage.
					3.	Better accuracy than any other boosting algorithm: It produces much more complex trees by following leaf wise split approach rather than a level-wise approach which is the main factor in achieving higher accuracy. 
					4.	Compatibility with Large Datasets: It is capable of performing equally good with large datasets with a significant reduction in training time as compared to XGBOOST.
